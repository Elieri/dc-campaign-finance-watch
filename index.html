      <p>Elections are about many things,
      but the two things we care most about here at
      DC Campaign Finance Watch are: (1) where candidates
      get their money, and (2) whether they are tell the public
      where they get their money. To help the public
      evaluate candidates along these two dimension,
      we have constructed two rankings of candidates who
      received contributions from more than 25 sources.  </p>

      <paper-tabs selected="0">
        <paper-tab id=0>Data Quality</paper-tab>
        <paper-tab id=1>Money Quality</paper-tab>
      </paper-tabs>

      <core-pages flex>
        <div id=0>
          <p>
            The following ranks candidates based on the completeness of the
            data that they file with the DC Office cf Campaign Finance.
            The most common failing in this respect
            is the failure to list data about the contributor's employer and employers address.  If you
            want to know why that data is important, have a look at
            <a href="http://wamu.org/projects/paytoplay">
            the recent reporting by WAMU</a> on pay-to-play.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide two measures of data quality. We rank candidates based on the proportion
            of their data that is complete. This includes the donors
            "Principal Place of Business", which  includes a business name and address.
            We exclude donors who list their employer as "unemployed" or "self".
            We also provide (though do not rank by) the percentage of data meeting the
            minimum standard required by law, which includes
            an employer name, but not address.
          </p>
          <table-element
            sourcefile="json/data-ranking-this-year.json"
            tabletitle="Ranking of Candidates by Percent of Reported Donors with Required Data">

          <p>
            We prefer candidates who raise money from people,
            and we dislike candidates who take corporate contributions.
            Why? At best corporate contributions distract candidates from what the
            citizenry -- as represented by actual citizens -- want them to do; at worst
            (and sadly we've seen a fair amount of this in the District), corporate
            contributions help a business at the expense of the District's residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            To measure the quality of the money that candidates raise, we look
            at the ratio of grassroots contributions (contributions from real people living
            in the District) to corporate contributions (including corporations, businesses,
            LLCs, LLPs, and related PACs.  Note that filings not containing
            information about source type is not included -- yet another reason
            to care about the quality of the data.
          </p>
